## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to utilize the **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** to generate synthetic knee X-ray images. In the medical field, acquiring labeled images for training neural networks is often challenging due to privacy concerns and the limited availability of high-quality datasets. This scarcity hinders research and development in medical imaging and machine learning.

By generating realistic knee X-ray images, this project aims to augment existing datasets, providing researchers and practitioners with a larger pool of data for training deep learning models. The generated images can be particularly useful in scenarios where annotated data is insufficient or inaccessible.

The WGAN-GP architecture is an advanced variant of traditional GANs that enhances the training process. It employs the Wasserstein distance as the loss function, which allows for a more meaningful measure of distance between the generated and real distributions. By incorporating a gradient penalty, WGAN-GP effectively stabilizes training and mitigates issues such as mode collapse. This stability enables the model to produce high-quality images with rich details quickly, as evidenced by the rapid improvement in image quality observed over the training epochs.

The implementation is detailed in the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/WGAN_GP.ipynb`, where various techniques are employed to ensure that the synthetic images are not only realistic but also suitable for further analysis in medical research.


## Results
The notebook demonstrates the WGAN-GP's ability to generate high-quality samples, and the included plots illustrate the model's performance over time.

The WGAN-GP implementation has produced noteworthy results, which are visualized in the following images:
1. **Generated Results**: This image displays examples of the outputs generated by the WGAN-GP model after training. The quality and diversity of the generated samples demonstrate the model's ability to capture the underlying distribution of the training data. <img width="1373" alt="results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e91c3553-9eaa-4d24-aeba-18e4a84451d3">
2. **Training Progress**: This graph illustrates the loss curves over the training epochs. As the training progresses, the quality of the generated knee X-ray images improves significantly, with each epoch revealing increasingly finer details and greater realism. The model quickly converges to satisfactory results, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning the underlying patterns of the training data from the very first epochs. This rapid enhancement highlights the capabilities of the WGAN-GP architecture in generating high-quality synthetic medical images. <img width="980" alt="epochs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3875843-5de6-4724-8fe3-9826b4ece755">
