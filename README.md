# Deep Learning Repository

This repository contains various deep learning projects and implementations with a focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main focus is the **WGAN-GP** (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty), presented in the notebook `notebooks/WGAN_GP.ipynb`. The repository includes relevant resources such as model architectures and reports related to the project.

## Project Overview
The WGAN-GP is an advanced version of the traditional GAN, designed to improve the convergence of GANs by using the Wasserstein distance as the loss function and incorporating a gradient penalty. This approach helps to avoid problems such as mode collapse and provides better stability during training.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates the WGAN-GP's ability to generate high-quality samples, and the included plots illustrate the model's performance over time.

The WGAN-GP implementation has produced noteworthy results, which are visualized in the following images:
1. **Generated Results**: This image displays examples of the outputs generated by the WGAN-GP model after training. The quality and diversity of the generated samples demonstrate the model's ability to capture the underlying distribution of the training data. <img width="1373" alt="results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e91c3553-9eaa-4d24-aeba-18e4a84451d3">
2. **Training Progress**: This graph illustrates the loss curves over the training epochs. As the training progresses, the quality of the generated knee X-ray images improves significantly, with each epoch revealing increasingly finer details and greater realism. The model quickly converges to satisfactory results, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning the underlying patterns of the training data from the very first epochs. This rapid enhancement highlights the capabilities of the WGAN-GP architecture in generating high-quality synthetic medical images. <img width="980" alt="epochs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3875843-5de6-4724-8fe3-9826b4ece755">
